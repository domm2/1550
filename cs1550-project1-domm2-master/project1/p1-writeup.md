Explain the pros and cons of using a FIFO queue (as compared to a hash table) for the global semaphore list.

Normally when choosing between a FIFO queue and a hash table, the hash table will win every time. Hash tables are efficient when it comes to large amounts of data. Yet, when we consider the semaphore list, hash tables aren't as optimal any longer. One reason for that is the global semaphore list's need for more structure, such as maintaining the order the semaphores are inserted. Hash tables do not maintain insertion order and therefore would ruin the point behind the semaphore list. We have to keep track of which process gets executed next. This is where we bring in the FIFO queue because it gives us first in first out item organization. Now that our processes are kept track of, we also need to make sure each and every process gets executed. Can we rely on a hash table for that? No. Hash tables do have a chance of starvation, but FIFO queues do not. Hash tables also require resizing due to the chance of becoming full. Resizing takes up time that FIFO queues do not even require. A disadvantage of FIFO queues is their inability to prioritize processes. This results in short processes getting stuck behind longer ones. This could be fixed with a priority queue though. All in all, hash tables are great structures to utilize, just not in this scenario due to the specifications we need to hit.
