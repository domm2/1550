My solution is deadlock and starvation free. Anytime there is a thread forced to wait, there is always a call to signal or broadcast. Each time a visitor shows up, if there are tickets left, it will wait until a guide admits them. When a guide admits a visitor it signals to one visitor to wake from waiting. That visitor will then check to make sure they are one of the specific guests it admitted. This is a huge part of the starvation-free portion. I implemented three variables: curenternum, enternum, & adminnum. These allowed me to keep track of how many guests were admitted and assign each arriving guest an order number. I then checked their order number against the admitted number to conclude if their number was called basically. It is a queue system that prevents a new guest from entering and touring before being admitted, in the middle of guests being admitted and touring, aka starvation. Another huge opportunity for deadlock and starvation is when the guide enters but if forced to wait because there are either a max amount of guides already inside or the current guides are in the middle of leaving. I prevented deadlock and starvation in this situation by creating a guidwait variable and incrementing it once a guide has finished admitting its visitors and is waiting to leave. Once this variable is above 0, no guide may enter until it is back at 1. Once a guide leave it broadcasts to other guides to enter and they check the guidwait value first.
